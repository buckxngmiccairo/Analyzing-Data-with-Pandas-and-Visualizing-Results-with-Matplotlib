✅ Dataset Suggestions
Instruction: “You can use publicly available datasets … The Iris dataset can be accessed via sklearn.datasets.load_iris().”
What I did: Used the Iris dataset (via seaborn.load_dataset("iris")).
✔️ Requirement satisfied.
🔹 Note: I used seaborn instead of sklearn.datasets.load_iris() because it loads directly into a Pandas DataFrame (easier to analyze). If you want, I can also show you the sklearn version.

✅ Plot Customization
Instruction: “Customize the plots using matplotlib … add titles, axis labels, legends. Use seaborn for styles.”
What I did:
All plots include titles, axis labels, and legends.
Used seaborn for the scatter plot (better style, color-coded by species).
✔️ Requirement satisfied.

✅ Error Handling
Instruction: “Handle possible errors during file reading (file not found, missing data, incorrect types).”
What I did:
Wrapped dataset loading in a try-except block → handles FileNotFoundError and general exceptions.
Checked for missing values with df.isnull().sum().
Cleaned dataset with .dropna().
✔️ Requirement satisfied.
